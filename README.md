# Java-Agency
In this project i created an information system that can help agencies managing and running operations.
The example i use here is on Investigation Agency, but it could be usefuel for different type of agencies.
The agency contains agents(detectives and investigators) and vehicles (cars and motorcycles) and you can create them by using txt file with all the fields required, i already added two txt files with Vehicles and Agents for example.
The purpose of the system is to help with the teaming of the agents and the distribution of the various tasks.
The user can create an agency and then open an operation(classified by level from 1 to 5), and the system will add the required amount of agents and vehicles to the operation according to the terms.
the user can also end the operation and get some information like Agents average years of experience, Operation cost, Most expensive vehicle etc.
